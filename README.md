# Location Ping Tester
(Dumb name I know)


A barebones android app that tracks your location based off of a WiFi network.

## Usage

First and foremost, this app **requires** location services to be enabled, but it never askes for it. So if you launch it and it says location required be sure to quit the app, then manually grant location permissions in settings.

From there just click the buton to start, and it will log your location via network to a file (called out.txt).

Note: When you click the button to start it clears the file of any previous data.
